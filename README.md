# Snake Game Project
## Description
This is a classic Snake Game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. Players are challenged to guide a snake through a series of obstacles while collecting food. As the snake eats, it grows longer and faster, adding a layer of complexity and excitement to the gameplay. The objective is simple yet captivating: accumulate the highest score possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own growing body.

## Features
- Simple User Interface: The game boasts a minimalist and easy-to-navigate user interface, ensuring a seamless gaming experience.
- Dynamic Snake Movement: Player navigates the snake across the screen using the arrow keys, providing an engaging and interactive experience.
- Progressive Difficulty: As the snake consumes food, it grows in length, making the game increasingly challenging and engaging.
- Score Tracking and Display: The player's score is dynamically updated, reflecting the number of foods the snake has consumed.
- Replayability: Post-game, players are given the option to either quit or restart the game, enhancing user engagement and replay value.


## Requirements and Setup
### System Requirements
- Installation of Python on computer. 
### Dependencies
- This game relies on the Pygame library for its game mechanics and graphical interface. Pygame can be easily installed using pip by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   'pip install pygame'

### Setup
1. Clone the repository in terminal:
   
   `git clone ###needs to be updated###`
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   
   `cd ###needs to be updated###`

3. Execute the game by running:

   `python snake_game.py`

## How to Play
- Use the arrow keys (↑, ↓, ←, →) to control the direction of the snake.
- Eat the green blocks (food) that appear randomly on the screen.
- Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer, and the score increases.
- Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.
- Press 'Q' to quit the game or 'C' to play again after losing.

## Game Mechanics
- This game is created using Pygame.
- The game window is set to 600 x 400 pixels.
- The snake moves in a grid and the food blocks spawn at random locations on grid.
- The game speed and the snake's growth rate are adjustable by changing the `snake_speed` and `length_of_snake`.
